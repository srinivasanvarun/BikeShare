# BikeShare
Machine Learning Project
There are a few components in this project. 
The inputs to the model are the day (weekday, holiday or weekends),
time and the season (daily temperature and season) and the output 
is the count of the number of bikes rented on that day. Given this 
information, the model will be trained on the second yearâ€™s data.
We attempt to predict the best time to rent a bike. In other words, 
we are trying to answer the question, when is bike renting a more 
popular choice.We also attempt to analyze the reason why some 
date/time combinations are more popular due to events, weather or 
any other factors . This prediction will help the bike-rental 
company to plan the potential number of bikes that will be 
rented on a particular date /time .
